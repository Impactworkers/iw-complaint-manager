# Impactworkers Complaint Manager 2.0 Wiki

## What is Complaint Manager 2.0?

The Complaint Manager is a case management platform that aids oversight agencies in monitoring and managing complaints across public institutions. With this tool, users can record complaint details and subsquently generate personalized letters based on this collected information. It also allows for for organization-wide collaboration through tracking, documentation, user tagging, notifications, audit logging and centralized case notes. Lastly, the tool enables the analysis of complaint data through visualizations. Users have the additional option to enable a public-facing page with the complaint data, to increase the transparency and accountability of their work. The tool is built with scalability and user configurability, allowing users to define their own data fields and workflows to suit their unique needs.

## Background and Purpose

Complaint Manager 1.0 was originally custom created by Thoughtworks for the Office of the Orleans Independent Police Monitor (NOIPM). The NOIPM is an independent, civilian police oversight agency created in August of 2009 to assist in raising complaints to the New Orleans Police Department.

Before the Complaint Manager was created, the NOIPM faced challenges with tracking, managing, and collaborating on complaint records. The NOIPM’s complaint intake process would take weeks so that Complaint Intake Specialist could gather the necessary details about the officers involved, the time and location of the incident, as well as complainants’ narratives. Coordination between Complaint Intake Specialists to process individual complaints was not a seamlessly collaborative effort, nor was there a clearly defined process to follow when collecting complaint information. Also, processed complaints were only available to review individually and there were no means to track complaint data collectively for analysis. Once the Complaint Manager was built, NOIPM had a much more streamlined complaint intake, management, and collaboration process.

In 2022, the Complaint Manager was expanded to support The Hawaii Correctional System Oversight Commission (HCSOC), a brand new organization set up to oversee prison conditions for all incarcerated Hawaiians. With this new organization, the system had organization-specific data, fields, databases, letter templates, etc. However the system was still limited and required multiple code changes for relatively small modifications, and did not meet the user demand for more self-service funtionalities. Due to the tool's limited scalability and customization, and strong interest from other organizations, the team decided to build the tool from ground-up and call it the The Complaint Manager 2.0. The team plans to actively build on and maintain Complaint Manager 1.0 for the existing users, until they are ready to use Complaint Manager 2.0.
