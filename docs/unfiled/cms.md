# Content Management Systems

A Content Management System (CMS) is a software application or set of related programs that are used to create and manage digital content. CMSes are typically used for enterprise content management (ECM) and web content management (WCM). An ECM facilitates collaboration in the workplace by integrating document management, digital asset management, and records retention functionalities, and providing end users with role-based access to the organization's digital assets. A WCM facilitates collaborative authoring for websites.

## Core Features

- **Content Creation**: Allows users to easily create and format content.
- **Content Storage**: Stores content in a database and manages access to this content through a file system or a cloud-based solution.
- **Workflow Management**: Supports the processes of content creation, review, approval, and publishing in a collaborative environment.
- **Publishing**: Allows for the content to be published to the live site or for the content to be scheduled for publication at a future date and time.
- **Search and Retrieval**: Enables users to search for and retrieve content.
- **User and Group Management**: Manages user access to the CMS, allowing for role-based permissions that control what users can and cannot do.
