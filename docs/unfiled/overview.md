## Understanding The Problem

Create an application that can track complaints logged against police officers for misconduct. This application will be used to store cases, officers linked to cases,  complainants,  generate letters, display images images, and other useful tools for tracking complaints.  We would like to have this application be open sourced and allowed to be used by different institutions nationwide. The application needs to be configurable to each institutions individual needs such as what functionalities they might want and how their UI will look. The app needs to be as cost effective as possible.
