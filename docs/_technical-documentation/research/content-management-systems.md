# Content Management Systems

A Content Management System (CMS) is a software application or set of related programs that are used to create and manage digital content. CMSes are typically used for enterprise content management (ECM) and web content management (WCM). An ECM facilitates collaboration in the workplace by integrating document management, digital asset management, and records retention functionalities, and providing end users with role-based access to the organization's digital assets. A WCM facilitates collaborative authoring for websites.

## Core Features

- **Content Creation**: Allows users to easily create and format content.
- **Content Storage**: Stores content in a database and manages access to this content through a file system or a cloud-based solution.
- **Workflow Management**: Supports the processes of content creation, review, approval, and publishing in a collaborative environment.
- **Publishing**: Allows for the content to be published to the live site or for the content to be scheduled for publication at a future date and time.
- **Search and Retrieval**: Enables users to search for and retrieve content.
- **User and Group Management**: Manages user access to the CMS, allowing for role-based permissions that control what users can and cannot do.

<summary> Purpose</summary>

#### Web Content Management (WCM) system

Drupal excels in creating, managing, and publishing web content. It provides a robust platform for websites, blogs, and web applications, offering features like customizable templates, user management, and content publishing workflows. Drupal is particularly known for its flexibility in building complex websites with diverse content types and intricate user interaction.

#### Enterprise Content Management (ECM) system

Drupal can manage and store an organization's documents, digital assets, and records. Through its extensible architecture and modules, Drupal can facilitate collaboration, automate workflows, and integrate with other business systems. Its capabilities can be extended to include document management, digital asset management, and records retention, making it suitable for enterprise-level content management requirements.

<summary> Key Features</summary>

#### Flexibility and Extensibility

##### Custom Content Types and Fields

Drupal allows for the creation of custom content types and fields, enabling you to tailor the content structure to match the specific needs of tracking complaints, managing case studies, or publishing informational content.

##### Modular Architecture

With thousands of modules (plugins) available, Drupal can be extended to include additional functionalities such as forums, user management, and complex search capabilities, without needing to develop these features from scratch.

#### User and Role Management

##### Advanced User Management
Drupal provides robust user management capabilities, including the creation of custom user roles and permissions. This feature is critical for an application that serves different institutions and user groups, allowing you to control access to sensitive information and functionalities based on the user's role.

##### Workflow and Access Control

It supports complex workflows and content access control mechanisms, essential for managing the review and publication process of complaints and related content.

#### Multi-Site Support

Drupal excels at managing multi-site architectures, allowing you to run multiple sites from a single Drupal codebase. This is particularly beneficial if you plan to deploy the application across different institutions, each with its own sub-site but sharing a common functionality set.

#### Security

##### Security Reports and Updates

Drupal has a dedicated security team that regularly publishes security advisories and updates. This proactive approach helps in identifying and fixing vulnerabilities swiftly.

##### Built-in Access Control and Permissions

Drupal provides extensive access control mechanisms and permissions that allow fine-grained control over who can view and manage content, making it easier to enforce strict security policies.

##### Community Vigilance

Being open-source, Drupal benefits from a large community of developers and users who contribute to the platform's security by identifying vulnerabilities and developing fixes.

##### Secure by Design

Drupal's core system has been designed with a focus on security, providing strong foundational elements that help prevent common security issues.

##### Extensibility with Security in Mind

Drupal's extensive library of modules allows for customization and extension of functionality without compromising on security. However, it's important to only use modules that are actively maintained and have a good security record.

##### Compliance Support

Drupal supports compliance with various security standards and regulations, making it easier for organizations to meet specific security requirements.

#### Scalability and Performance

##### Scalability

Drupal can scale to support high traffic loads and large amounts of content, which is crucial for applications expected to grow over time.

##### Caching and Performance Optimization

It includes built-in caching and a variety of advanced performance optimization options to ensure the application remains fast and responsive as it scales.

#### Integration Capabilities

##### API-First Approach

With its latest versions, Drupal has adopted an API-first approach, making it easier to integrate with other systems and technologies, including React for the frontend. This means you can use Drupal as a headless CMS to manage content while leveraging React and MUI components for a dynamic and engaging user interface.

<summary>Database Support</summary>

MySQL and PostgreSQL are the most commonly used databases with Drupal, it also supports other database systems, especially with the improvements made in Drupal 7 and later versions which introduced a database abstraction layer. This abstraction layer allows for the integration of Drupal with various database engines. The main databases supported by Drupal include:

##### MySQL/MariaDB

MySQL is the most widely used database with Drupal. MariaDB, a fork of MySQL, is fully compatible with Drupal and often used as a drop-in replacement.

##### PostgreSQL

Known for its standards compliance and advanced features, PostgreSQL is another popular choice among Drupal developers for sites requiring complex data management.

##### SQLite

Drupal supports SQLite, which is a lightweight, file-based database. SQLite is often used for testing, small sites, or development purposes due to its simplicity and easy setup.

##### SQL Server

Drupal supports Microsoft SQL Server, especially in environments where Microsoft technologies are predominant. This support is mainly facilitated through contributed modules that extend Drupal's database compatibility.

##### Oracle

While not supported out of the box, there are contributed modules and solutions in the Drupal community that enable integration with Oracle databases for enterprises that rely on Oracle's database solutions.

{: .note }
It's important to note that while Drupal can work with these database systems, the level of support, performance, and features available may vary depending on the database used. MySQL and MariaDB tend to have the most comprehensive support due to their widespread use and the active development of Drupal modules for these platforms. For other databases like SQL Server and Oracle, additional modules or configurations may be required to achieve full functionality. Always check the specific requirements and support status for the Drupal version you are using when considering a database system.
